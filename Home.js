                  Our platform uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze social media profiles and media content. 
                  We examine multiple factors including account behavior patterns, image metadata, 
                  manipulation signatures, and AI-generation markers to provide a comprehensive 
                  authenticity assessment with confidence ratings.
